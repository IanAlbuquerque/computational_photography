 Files and Folders:
================================================================================

 	main.py
 		Asks the user if they want to use the precompute function or the online
		function. Acts as the user interface.

	seam_carving.py
		This file contains all the necessary functions for the preprocessing and the
		online parts of the assignment. This is the heart of the project.

	precompute.py
		Opens the image and energy mask and calculates the order of importance of each
		pixel in both horizontal and vertical deletions. Saves the ".ord" file.

	online.py
		Asks the user which operation will be performed on the image and computes
		that operation. Reads an ".ord" file

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	botinas.jpg
		The input image file.

	botinas.ord
		A pixel order file has been included in case the precomputing module takes
		a lot of time to compute. This file is written by the precomputing module
		and read by the online module.

	botinas_mask.jpg
		A sample energy mask that can be used for feature deletion.

 Instructions:
================================================================================

	When executing main.py you will be prompted to choose between the options of
	the precomputation and the online function. In order to use the online function,
	first you need to choose the precomputation option.

	Running the precomputation option will create in the same directory a ".ord"
	file. This file contains the information of the order of deletion for each
	pixel in the image. This ".ord" file will be used as part of the input for
	the online function.

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	A pixel order file (".ord") has been included in case the precomputing module takes
	a lot of time to compute. This file is written by the precomputing module
	and read by the online module.

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	In order to input an energy mask (for feature removing), it is necessary to 
	change constants in main.py. A sample mask is provided.
