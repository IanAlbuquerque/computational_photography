Files and Folders:
================================================================================

	part0/
		Folder containing part 0 of the project (sharpening with high pass filters)

			cat.jpg
				Sample image for the part 0. This image will be used as input 
				for the sharpening.

			main.py
				The main code for part 0. Will execute the sharpening algorithm
				on the image "cat.jpg"

	part1/
		Folder containing part 1 of the project (hybrid images)

			aligned_mona.jpg
				The aligned version of "mona.jpg". This file
				is used as input for "fourier.jpg", that shows the Fourier Transform
				of this image.

			aligned_venus.jpg
				The aligned version of "venus.jpg". This file
				is used as input for "fourier.jpg", that shows the Fourier Transform
				of this image.

			align_image_code.jpg
				An auxiliary library that aligns two image, given two points in each
				image as reference. Included in "color.py" and "gray.py"

			color.py
				The file that contains the code for creating the hybrid images with
				colors. It uses "venus.jpg" and "mona.jpg" to create a hybrid
				version of them: the vemona.

			fourier.py
				The file that contains the code for showing the Fourier Transform of
				given images. It uses "aligned_mona.jpg", "aligned_venus.jpg" and
				"vemona.jpg" to create their fourier transforms.

			gray.py
				The file that contains the code for creating the hybrid images in grayscale.
				It uses "venus.jpg" and "mona.jpg" to create a hybrid version of them:
				the vemona.

			main.py
				The main code for part 1. Will execute the code in the files
				"gray.py", "color.py" and "fourier.py".

			mona.jpg
				One of the two inputs for the hybrid image.

			vemona.jpg
				The result of the blending of mona.jpg and venus.jpg. This file
				is used as input for "fourier.jpg", that shows the Fourier Transform
				of this image.

			venus.jpg
				One of the two inputs for the hybrid image.

	part2/
		Folder containing part 2 of the project (stacks)

		main.py
			The main code for part 2. Will create the Gaussian and Laplacian stacks for
			the image "vemona.jpg"

		vemona.jpg
			The input image for this part of the project.

	part3/
		Folder containing part 3 of the project (blending)

		lion.jpg
			One of the two inputs for the image blending.

		main.py
			The main code for part 3. Will create a blended version of
			the files "lion.jpg" and "mico.jpg" by using "milion_mask.jpg"
			as mask.

		mico.jpg
			One of the two inputs for the image blending.

		milion_mask.jpg
			The mask that will be used for the blending.
