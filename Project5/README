 Special thanks to Alexei Alyosha Efros, Rachel Albert and Weilun Sun for help
 during lectures, office hours and questions on Piazza.

 Files and Folders:
================================================================================

 	main.py
 		The main code for the problem. Calculate 10 frames for the morphing of
 		obama.jpg into dilma.jpg

 	dilma.jpg
 		One of the input files for the morphing.

 	obama.jpg
 		One of the input files for the morphing.

 	obilma.pts
 		The file that stores the points in both images. It has a preset set of
 		points included here.

 	other_codes
 		This folder contains some other pieces of code used for the other parts
 		of the project. The main part of the code is included in main.py. Here,
 		the only difference is the use of different input methods (because those
 		code use multiple images as input)

 		IMPORTANT: Those codes should not be running because of the lack of
 		appropriate input, not provided. They are also not refactored.
 		They are here just because they were used for the final presentation.

 		avg.py
 			The code for the population averaging. Not refactored.

 		face_move.py
 			The code for the face animation. Not refactored.
